0.6.3
-----

* I'll be making an effort to maintain a changelog on each release now so that you guys can actually know what's creeping in with each update.

* From the initial release, a number of minor bug fixes have been released and the package now has some test coverage to prevent breakages.

* Notifications are now displayed when no results are returned by Jedi. If you find something is not acting the way you expect it to, it probably is Jedi failing to find what you're looking for. You should probably post an Issue on their page.

* The README has been updated to explain each feature with a short gif demo .

* A new feature in the form of "Select String" has been added. See the README for a demo.
